                            <h4>âž¤ How do you ensure your products are actually sustainable and eco-friendly?</h4>
                            <p>This is the most important question for us! We have a rigorous vetting process for every product and brand we partner with. Our commitment to sustainability is based on several key criteria:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Materials:</strong> Products must be made from renewable, recycled, upcycled, or all-natural materials (like organic cotton, bamboo, reclaimed wood, or glass). We prioritize items that are biodegradable or easily recyclable.</li>
                                <li><strong>Durability & Longevity:</strong> A core principle of sustainability is reducing consumption. We select high-quality products that are built to last, replacing the need for disposable, single-use alternatives.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                            <p>We share your concern! We are committed to plastic-free packaging:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Boxes:</strong> Recycled cardboard boxes.</li>
                                <li><strong>Filler/Padding:</strong> Recycled kraft paper or compostable cornstarch peanuts instead of plastic bubble wrap or air pillows.</li>

                            <h4>âž¤ E-commerce shipping has a large carbon footprint. What are you doing about that?</h4>
                            <p>You're right, and we take the environmental impact of shipping very seriously. To combat this, we offer carbon-neutral shipping on every single order. Hereâ€™s how it works: We calculate the carbon emissions generated by the delivery of your package. Then, we partner with certified environmental organizations to purchase carbon offsets that fund projects like reforestation, renewable energy, and methane capture.</p>

                            <p><b>'In Stock'</b> For items listed as "In Stock", Sellers will mention the delivery time based on your location pincode (usually 2-3 business days, 4-5 business days or 4-6 business days in areas where standard delivery service is available). For other areas, orders will be sent by Registered Post through the Indian Postal Service which may take 1-2 weeks depending on the location.</p>
                            <p><b>'Available'</b> The Seller might not have the item in stock but can procure it when an order is placed for the seller. The delivery time will depend on the estimated procurement time and the estimated shipping time to your location.</p>
                            <p><b>'Preorder' or 'Forthcoming'</b> Such items are expected to be released soon and can be pre-booked for you. The item will be shipped to you on the day of its official release launch and will reach you in 2 to 6 business days.</p>
                            <p><b>'Out of Stock'</b> Currently, the item is not available for sale. Use the 'Notify Me' feature to know once it is available for purchase.</p>
                            <p><b>'Imported'</b> Sometimes, items have to be sourced by Sellers from outside India. These items are mentioned as 'Imported' on the product page and can take at least 10 days or more to be delivered to you.</p>
                            <p><b>'Back In Stock Soon'</b> The item is popular and is sold out. You can however 'book' an order for the product and it will be shipped according to the timelines mentioned by the Seller.</p>
                            <p><b>'Temporarily Unavailable'</b> The product is currently out of stock and is not available for purchase. The product could be in stock soon. Use the 'Notify Me' feature to know when it is available for purchase.</p>

                            <p>No, once an order is placed, the specifications of the product (like color or size) cannot be modified. You would need to cancel the original order and place a new one.</p>

                            <p>A cancellation fee may be applied if an eligible order is cancelled more than 24 hours after it was placed. This fee helps compensate the seller for processing the order and our logistics partners for any shipping costs incurred if the item was already dispatched.</p>

                            <p>A greyed-out 'Cancel' button usually indicates one of the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The item is already out for delivery or has been delivered.</li>
                                <li>The item is non-refundable (e.g., digital products like Gift Cards).</li>
                                <li>The standard cancellation window has passed.</li>
                            </ul>
